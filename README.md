# DPS-meter
Easy way to check your dps in a certain anime game.

Plugin to spawn some mobs around you. It will start a challenge which will text your dps in chat.
It spawns mitachurl with axe but without his axe which crashed his ai and he stay afk. All what you need is hit him one time.

###### *(found that randomly not sure that will work forever, open an issue if you have any idea how to improve that xD)*
